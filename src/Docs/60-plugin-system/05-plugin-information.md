To provide Shopware and the shop owner with information about your plugin, you have to supply a `composer.json` with your plugin.
Some information are gathered through the default properties of a `composer.json`.
For some Shopware specific information, you have to extend the `extra` property.
Have a look at the [composer schema](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md), to learn more about the properties.

## Example `composer.json`
```json
