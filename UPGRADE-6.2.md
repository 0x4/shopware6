UPGRADE FROM 6.1.x to 6.2
=======================

Core

Administration
--------------


Storefront
----------

* We removed the SCSS skin import `@import 'skin/shopware/base'` inside `/Users/tberge/www/sw6/platform/src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/base.scss`.
    * If you don't use the `@Storefront` bundle in your `theme.json` and you are importing the shopware core `base.scss` manually you have to import the shopware skin too in order to get the same result:

        Before
        ```
        @import "../../../../vendor/shopware/platform/src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/base.scss";
        ```

        After
        ```
        @import "../../../../vendor/shopware/platform/src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/base.scss";
        @import "../../../../vendor/shopware/platform/src/Storefront/Resources/app/storefront/src/scss/skin/shopware/base";
